# Post Order Traversal:


# Pre Order Traversal:


# LCA:
# In a binary search tree, an *ancestor* of a `example_node` is a node
# that is on a higher level than `example_node`, and can be traced directly
# back to `example_node` without going up any levels. (I.e., this is
# intuitively what you think an ancestor should be.) Every node in a binary
# tree shares at least one ancestor -- the root. In this exercise, write a
# function that takes in a BST and two nodes, and returns the node that is the
# lowest common ancestor of the given nodes. Assume no duplicate values.




# test cases

bst = BinarySearchTree.new
[5, 3, 7, 1, 4, 9, 0, 2, 1.5, 10].each do |el|
  bst.insert(el)
